C 7
Carbide Tip
Solid piece carbide with four 
cutting faces to prevent jamming 
in rebar. 
Provides cleaner, more  
concentric holes and constant  
high drilling speed. 
The carbide tip and body are 
brazed together via an innovative 
welding technique creating a 
strong durable bond.
Reduced Vibration
Impact force spread over  
four cutting faces. 
Durability
Optimised heat treatment for  
maximum strength. 
Speed
4 ﬂute helix maximises debris 
removal for fast drilling and clear 
holes. Long helix length with 
optimised free space for faster 
debris removal.
FIitments
Both SDS-max and SDS-plus  
ﬁtments available, matched to 
common rebar sizes.
Fast dust-free drilling 
in concrete
Vacuum assisted dust extraction 
means less dust, reduced 
resistance, faster drilling,  
and less hole cleaning.
Airlock™ Adaptor
Connects directly to the DEWALT®  
AIRLOCK™ System forming 
a secure, locking connection 
between bit and dust extractor.
Carbide cutters 
Provides exact positioning, 
delivering accurate starting  
and optimising durability.
Optimum Impact 
Transmission
Maximised central core enables 
more efﬁcient energy transmission 
to the drill bit head.
Core Reinforcement
For optimum impact and breakage 
stability. Enables more efﬁcient 
energy transmission to the drill  
bit head. 
Carbide Tip
The solid two cutter head is 
ﬂanked by two individual cutting 
tips delivering a fast and efﬁcient 
drilling speed. These carbide tips 
and body are brazed together to 
create a strong and durable bond.
Speed 
4 ﬂute helix with maximum  
ﬂute entry enables faster  
debris removal.
Carbide Drill Head
Optimised drill head design  
with 2 cutting edges
Core Reinforcement
For optimum impact energy  
transmission and breakage 
resistance.
2 Flute Helix
For efﬁciant debris removal.
