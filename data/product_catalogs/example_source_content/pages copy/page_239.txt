Coated Abrasives
Abrasive mesh  
Support material made of durable  
nylon braid.
Silicon carbide abrasive grain of the 
grating by a special composite  process is 
applied to the nylon braid. This reduces the 
ﬂexibility, but increases the lifetime up to  
4x compared to DEWALT® standard 
abrasives.
Due to the large number of small openings 
in the grid lines, the suction power is 
signiﬁcantly increased since the grinding 
dust is transported away over a larger 
surface. This results in a ﬁner ﬁnish.
After intensive use, the grinding dust can  
be simply tapped or blown out.
Standard abrasives
High-quality aluminium oxide grains  
for a perfect surface ﬁnish. 
Flap discs
For use with angle grinders.
