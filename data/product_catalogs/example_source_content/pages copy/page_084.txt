Mitre saw 250 mm
DWS778
• XPS indicates line of cut and helps to quicker align the material and 
disc. Does not require calibration. 
• Outstanding cutting results due to very high cutting speed.
• Standard mitre cuts of 0°/15°/22.5°/30° and 45°, including smooth 
quick adjustment to 48°. 
• Precise double mitre cuts up to 45°/45° (left) • Especially suitable 
for wide panels (up to 305 × 85 mm) • Excellent cutting depth 
85 mm (at 90°) • Flat milled base plate made of high-quality die-cast 
aluminium. 
• Accurate cutting results thanks to the precision workpiece stop 
(sliding sideways to the left). 
• Ideal for assembly due to light weight and compact dimensions  
(W × H × D: 450 × 470 × 600 mm).
