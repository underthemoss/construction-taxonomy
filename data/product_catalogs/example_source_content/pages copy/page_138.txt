CONCRETE DRILL BITS
APPLICATIONS
Ideal for fast drilling of anchor and plug holes in concrete.
FOR USE WITH
SDS-plus hammer drills.
 
 
SDS-plus 2 CUTTER
TOUGHCORE™*
Tapered central core increases stability and 
durability and increases breakage resistance.
2-STAGE HELIX*
Effective dust removal improves 
drilling performance.
WEAR MARK*
Indicates that the holes you drill are the 
diameter you need - ideal for accurate 
mechanical anchor installation.
*WEAR MARK, TOUGHCORE™ and 2-stage helix are not available on all SKUs - see distributor listing  
for details. The WEAR MARK is an indicator of the bit’s ability to drill a speciﬁed hole diameter.
WEAR MARK*
 
The wear mark is visible - this indicates that  
the bit is drilling a hole to the required diameter.
The wear mark is no longer visible - the bit has 
had extensive use, potentially compromising the 
diameter of the drilled hole.
2 STAGE HELIX*
This accelerates the removal of any 
concrete mill from the tip, reducing  
the working temperature and speeding 
up drilling.
FEATURES
TOUGHCORE™*
 
Adds strength and resistance when drilling deep 
holes with increased side loads.
Reduces ﬂexing between the ﬂute and shank, 
preventing bit fracturing.
HELIX
Made in Germany.
