RECIPROCATING SAW BLADES
 
 
 CARBIDE RECIPROCATING SAW BLADES
 
FEATURES
•  FAST MATERIAL REMOVAL. Larger gullets remove material 
more quickly*, decreasing cutting time.
•  FAST CUTS IN DEMANDING DEMOLITION APPLICATIONS
•  Titanium coating makes teeth more wear-resistant so they 
stay sharp for 2x faster* cuts.
•  STANDS UP TO TOUGH APPLICATIONS. Tall and thick blade 
proﬁle adds durability and minimises blade breaks.
•  ENGINEERED FOR PERFORMANCE. Each tooth is precision 
ground to cut through a wide range of metals and nail 
embedded wood.
•  UP TO 10X LONGER LIFE*. High performance carbides are 
welded to the cutting edge for durability and to help prevent 
tooth loss.
 
*Compared to DEWALT bi-metal blades
 
FOR USE WITH
 
Corded and cordless reciprocating saws.
