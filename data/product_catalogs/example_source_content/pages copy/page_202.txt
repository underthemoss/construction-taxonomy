TOOTH GEOMETRY
FLAT TOP GRIND (FT)
Tooth geometry, in which the cutting edge of the tooth is ground 
straight and without any inclination. This tooth form is used for 
longitudinal cuts and for universal applications if high cutting quality 
is less important.
TRIPLE CHIP GRIND (TCG)
Tooth geometry, in which a ﬂat tooth is alternately arranged, followed 
by a slightly higher trapezoidal ground tooth. This higher tooth cuts 
correspondingly deeper, however, due to its upper edges which are 
chamfered on both sides, but somewhat narrower than the following 
ﬂat tooth. This makes the splitting of brittle materials, e.g. laminate 
is prevented. 
ALTERNATE TOP BEVEL (ATB)
Tooth geometry, in which the cutting edges of the teeth are 
alternately obliquely ground, the angle being from 10° to 20°.  
For universal use but ideal for cross cuts in hardwood and softwood. 
HOLLOW GROUND (HG)
Tooth geometry, in which the teeth have been ground to a concave 
proﬁle that produces clean cuts in melamine and other coated 
boards, without the need for scoring.
