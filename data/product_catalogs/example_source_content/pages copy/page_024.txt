A 20
XR SYSTEM, 18 V
Lubrication press 18 V
DCGG571M1
• Ideal for lubricating construction, agricultural, forestry 
machinery and equipment • Performs normal lubrication up to 
twice as fast as a manual grease gun • Output pressure 690 bar 
(10,000 psi) with flow rate of 147 g of grease per minute • Hose 
length 1 m for access to hard-to-reach grease fittings • The vent 
valve allows the user to release accumulated excess air that may 
affect the pressure and speed of work • LED helps to illuminate 
hard-to-access grease fittings • The tool comes with a shoulder 
strap. Makes lubrication easier when ascending and descending 
on the machine • It can be filled continuously (suction or pump) or 
can be used filled with 400 g of grease.
