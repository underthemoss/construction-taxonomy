WATER RESISTANT
After intensive use, dust can be easily washed off. After drying, the abrasive mesh is ready for use again
ABRASIVE MESH
FEATURES
The silicon carbide grain is 
applied to the nylon braid 
by a special composite 
process. This reduces the 
ﬂexibility, but increases 
the service life up to 4x 
compared to DEWALT® 
standard abrasives.
Due to the large number  
of small openings in the 
grid lines, the suction 
capacity is signiﬁcantly 
increased as the dust  
is transported over  
a signiﬁcantly  
larger surface.
APPLICATIONS
For all basic, intermediate 
and ﬁnal sanding 
applications in wood, 
metal, paints, varnishes, 
plaster and drywall.
EASY PLACEMENT
The open structure of the grid  
lines eliminates the need for  
precise positioning.
LONGER DURABILITY
Up to 4x longer life compared to DEWALT®  
standard abrasive papers by better  
removal of the sanding dust.
UP TO 25% BETTER SANDING RESULTS
The open weave structure enables a more  
effective removal of sanding dust.  
This results in a ﬁner sanding pattern.
