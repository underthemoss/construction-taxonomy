Metal Drill Bits
HSS-CO
For use in high-alloyed 
steels up to 1100 N/mm² 
tensile strength, grey  
and malleable, acid  
and heat-resistant  
and stainless steels. 
Ground drill bit, made  
of cobalt-alloyed 
 high-speed steel  
(5% cobalt) for maximum 
temperature resistance  
and wear resistance.
HSS-G
For use in alloyed  
and unalloyed steels  
up to 900 N/mm²  
tensile strength, sheet 
metal and thin-walled 
proﬁle materials, wood  
and plastics.
Ground drill bit made of 
one piece for an increased 
resistance to breakage  
and clean holes.
HSS-TIN
For use in alloyed  
and unalloyed steels  
up to 900 N/mm²  
tensile strength, sheet 
metal and thin-walled 
proﬁle materials, wood  
and plastics.
Ground drill bit with 
titanium coating reduces 
friction, lowers drilling 
temperature and increases 
product life.
In addition the titanium 
coating is both  
wear resistant and 
corrosian resistant. 
  
 
Black & Gold
For clean, accurate  
holes in steel, alloyed  
and non-alloyed sheet 
metal. Also ideal for basic 
drilling applications in 
wood, plastic and other  
thin materials.
A tough, tapered core 
provides strength and 
durability and a no-spin 
shank eliminates the bits 
spinning in the chuck.
Constructed from High 
Speed Steel for wear 
resistance and longer  
bit life.
 
HSS-R
For use in alloyed and 
unalloyed steels up to  
900 N/mm² tensile strength, 
sheet metal and thin-walled 
proﬁle materials, wood  
and plastics.
Rolled drill bit made 
of one piece.
