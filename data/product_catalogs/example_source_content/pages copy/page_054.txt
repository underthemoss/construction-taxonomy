LINE LASERS POWERED BY XR RECHARGEABLE BATTERY 10.8 V AND 12 V
Cross and 5-point laser 10,8 V
DCE0825D1G / DCE0825D1R
•  Cross projection function in a range of 150° 
•  Lower plumb line with increased visibility allows laser to be 
mounted and accurately aligned even on suspended ceilings. 
•  Rubberized body, IP65 protection and 2 m drop resistance, 
increases durability and longevity. 
•  Lock for laser diode heads protects against damage during 
transport. 
•  Thread for attachment to 1/4 and 5/8 stand. The mounting 
thread allows fine forward and backward adjustments in the 
laser when the laser is on a tripod. 
•  Operating time: 1 beam 14 hours, 2 beams 8 hours, points more 
than 50 hours. 
•  Battery charge status indicator.
•  DCE0825D1G: green beam
•  DCE0825D1R: red beam

Laser cross 10.8 V
DCE088D1G / DCE088D1R / DCE088LR
• Cross laser with automatic self-levelling powered by DeWalt 
10.8 V battery. 
• Emits bright GREEN horizontal and vertical beams that form 
a cross. 
• The green beam is 4 times brighter than the red one, and is more 
visible. 
• Can also be used with a receiver signal. 
• Protection class IP65 and 2 m drop test. 
• The LED’s swing lock helps prevent damage.
• DCE088D1G: green beam, one 10.8 V rechargeable battery
• DCE088D1R: red beam, one 10.8 V rechargeable battery
•  DCE088LR: red beam, no battery, with adapter for 4 AA 
batteries.

• Cross laser with automatic 2 × 360° self-levelling powered by 
DeWalt 10.8 V rechargeable battery. 
• Emits bright GREEN horizontal and vertical beams that form 
a cross. 
• The green beam is 4 times brighter than the red one, and is more 
visible. 
• Can also be used with a receiver signal. 
• Protection class IP65 and 2 m drop test. 
• The LED’s swing lock helps prevent damage.
• DCE0811D1G: green beam, one 10.8 V rechargeable battery
