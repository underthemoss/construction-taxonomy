METAL BLADES 
 
FEATURES 
 
Steel Cutting
•  Crafted with 12% titanium carbide, DEWALT® Metal Cutting™ 
saw blades tackle tough steel cutting applications with ease. 
•  Modiﬁed ATB tooth geometry provides clean, burr-free 
cuts, and expansion slots dissipate heat, extending blade 
life. A tri-foil braze boosts the strength of each tooth tip for 
extreme durability.
 
Stainless Steel (Inox) Cutting
•  Designed to power through stainless steel with ease, 
DEWALT® stainless steel Metal Cutting™ saw blades are 
crafted from carbide for long life and less chipping. Each 
blade is laser-etched and color-coded by material.
 
 Aluminium Cutting
•  Backed by an ultra-thin kerf blade for fast cutting and helps 
to increased battery life, DEWALT® Metal Cutting™ saw 
blades are built to power through aluminum and non-ferrous 
metals, including brass and copper. 
•  Heavy-duty tungsten carbide tips maintain a sharp edge  
for long life, and an anti-stick rim helps to reduce  
friction and gum-up.
