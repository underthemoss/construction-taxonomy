structure used for rugged stock removal of 
metal in bonded abrasives, and metal and 
wood in coated abrasives.
CERAMIC
Tough durable grain with very ﬁne crystal 
structure to create many more cutting  
edges in each grain. Used for the highest 
stock removal of metal in bonded and 
coated abrasives.
SILICON CARBIDE
Very hard and brittle grain used on concrete 
and very soft or very hard metals in bonded 
abrasives, and for very ﬁne ﬁnishing of
