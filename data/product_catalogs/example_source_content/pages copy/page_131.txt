Manufacturing
To ensure maximum performance and customer

and the most advanced production and quality 
management process.
Product Development
Through extensive and continuous ﬁeld research, 
DEWALT® has gained a comprehensive knowledge 
of user needs and applications. Its world class 
development facility utilises the latest Catia CAD 
system and automated test equipment to develop and 
test all drill bits prior to and during manufacture.
Quality Control
DEWALT® is a long standing member of PRUF 
GEMEINSCHAFT MAUERBOHRER (PGM), an 
internationally recognised organisation that veriﬁes 
the suitability of drill bits for use in anchor ﬁxing. 
To test drill bit life and durability, 1 million holes are 
drilled into 350 tonnes of concrete each year. If there 
is any variability in quality, it is detected before the 
products are delivered to the end user. All drill bits are 
certiﬁed to the latest ISO 9001:200 quality standards.
